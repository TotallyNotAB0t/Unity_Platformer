Everything else was made from scratch.
Here is the current working features :
- Movement of the player on the X & Y axis
- Jump movement
- Sprite facing the direction you are moving
- Saw that kills the player
- Restart mechanic when touching the saw
- Every movement animated, except death.
- Small Menu with 2 buttons : one to switch to the game scene, the other to quit the app
- Add checkpoints
- Add a real death (and don't allow the player to move)

Features to be implemented :
- Add lives
- Add ennemies + their scripted movement
- Add moving platforms
- Maybe add a walljump feature
- More to come :)

Thanks for passing by. Feel free to correct my bad code ðŸ’» any time !
