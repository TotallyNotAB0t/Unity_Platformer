- Saw that kills the player
- Restart mechanic when touching the saw
- Every movement animated, except death.
- Small Menu with 2 buttons : one to switch to the game scene, the other to quit the app
- Added checkpoints
- Added a real death (and don't allow the player to move)
- Added ennemies + their scripted movement ðŸŽŠ
- Added lives (animated)
- Added moving platforms
- Added collectibles !!

Features to be implemented :

- Maybe add a walljump feature
